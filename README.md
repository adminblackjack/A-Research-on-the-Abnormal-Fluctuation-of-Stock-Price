# College-Students-Innovation-Project
A repository for a project (2021~2022, in progress)

This repository is used to record, store and show my plan, code and experience about my project, namely 'A Research on Quantitative Investment Model Based on Machine Learning and Abnormal Fluctuation of Trading Volume and Price'. This is a project for my school's College Students' Innovation Project and I want to complete it successfully.

To be frank, I am not sure whether or not I can do it well because this research topic is so hard, complex and time-consuming, and I barely know anything about Machine Learning or Finance. However, I am still determined to complete this task.

I will not put all my code in this repository because I do not want anyone who is researching on the similar topic to copy my achievements, WHICH IS WHAT I AM UNWILLING TO SEE! What I am planning to do is just record the key parts. Correspondingly, there is no limit on reading or copying anything I upload to this repository.

Best wishes!
